# 3DConnexionAPI
Java API implementation for the Connexion 3D mouse.

## Prerequisites
* [Java 8 JDK](http://www.java.com) (But code can be easily changed to an earlier version)
* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) (As development environment) 
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (For the C/C++ tools on a MAC)

## Building

Building the dynamic library <em>libConnexionAPI</em> and the jar can be done either from command line or from Eclipse. To build from command line and run a small demo, open a terminal. 
```
cd <ProjectDirectory>/jni
make all
java -jar ConnexioAPI.jar 
```
### Tips
We need the Connexion header files. So the driver has to be installed. On a MAC it is located in <em>/Library/Frameworks/3DConnexionClient.framework</em>. To help the compiler finding the header files, we have created a symbolic link.

The <makefile> uses an environment variable <b>JAVA_HOME</b> to find the JNI header files. This include path has to be set in
Eclipse to build in Eclipse. 

The header file <em>de_hjbflyer_connexion3dapi_ConnexionApi.h</em> is automatically generated by running
```
make all
```

## JavaDoc
To generate the JavaDoc
```
make documentation
```

## Dynamic Library
The initial version of this project does support OS X only. To build for other operating systems, the <b>makefile</b>
has to be adapted.

To use the API you have to include the dynamic library <b>libConnexionAPI.jnilib</b> in your library load path.
